    "content": "There is a room where letters go to die. Bere, the archivist, calls it the Officializing Chamber \u2014 a liter-measure of silence poured into stone walls. She fastens each envelope to its hook with the tenderness of someone dressing a wound. The oboe on the shelf hasn't been played in years, but sometimes it hums on its own, a double-reed ghost producing notes that chase away the dust. Bere says the room decides what is official and what is fleeting. She says this hushed, as if the walls are skin. Tonight three people have come to tell their stories. They sit on the wooden bench, coats still lashed with rain, and Bere lights the lamp that means: speak. The flame inverts their shadows \u2014 tall where they are small, trembling where they are still. \"One at a time,\" Bere whispers. \"The room is listening.\"",

    "content": "The first to speak is a man everyone calls Poor, though his real name has been officialized away. \"I carried something,\" he begins, voice tense. \"An object \u2014 rtpauue \u2014 I don't know its proper word. Ornate. Excess made solid.\" He found it in a field where the dal plants grew waist-high, their lentil pods rattling like teeth. It changed him. His skin felt reversible, as though he could be turned inside out by looking at it too long. He glided through weeks unable to explain the lash-marks it left on his thoughts. \"I tried to destroy it,\" Poor says. \"I threw it into the metric pond behind the church.\" But the pond roared \u2014 actually roared \u2014 and the thing surfaced, producing a symptom he can only describe as movement-that-isn't-movement. He fled. He is still fleeing. Bere nods. The oboe hums a single, disorienting note.",

    "content": "The second speaker doesn't sit. She paces, and her name \u2014 Ninil \u2014 reads the same from either end. \"I was integrated into the system,\" she says, \"then deprived of it.\" The officialization papers caught her in duplicate: two files, two identities, one body. She became eahisyy in one ledger, fueure in another. Each version glided through bureaucracy like a separate life. She tried to fasten them together, to assert herself as singular, but the system produced excess \u2014 two coats mailed to her door, two positions offered, two death certificates pre-printed. \"I am chasing away my own ghost,\" she says, her tone somewhere between tender and paranoid. She uncovered the error by reading her own letters, addressed to selves she hadn't yet become. Now she carries both names like a coat worn inside out, afraid that resolving the duplication would destroy not one life but both. The oboe plays two notes at once \u2014 a sound that shouldn't exist.",

    "content": "The third visitor has fallen asleep on the bench. Bere doesn't wake him. She knows this one \u2014 yeta tucked in his pocket, dal stains on his fingers, the same fleeting expression as all who arrive here escaping something they cannot name. She takes the oboe down from the shelf. Her breath enters the reed and the room fills with a transcendent, melancholic gliding \u2014 a sound that integrates all the fear and ornament and officializing into a single, hushed roar. The letters on their hooks tremble. Poor, still standing, feels his skin settle. Ninil stops pacing. The sleeping man murmurs a word \u2014 \"bere\" \u2014 which is also the archivist's name, which is also an old word for carrying, for bearing what cannot be put down. The flame inverts again. The room decides: nothing here is official. Everything here is true. Bere plays until the rain stops, and then she fastens the oboe back to its hook, and the silence that follows is not empty but full \u2014 a metric vessel brimming with all the fleeting things that refused, despite everything, to escape.\n\n---",
