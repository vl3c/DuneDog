    "content": "(Based on Skeletons 1 & 8: Disorienting, Military Action, Heat)\n\nThe heat in the convoy was absolute, a heavy coat that immobilized us against the vinyl seats. Sergeant Kells initiated the **distribution**; he handed me the canister marked **RSPO**. It felt delicate, vibrating like a trapped bird. \"Don't listen to it,\" Kells warned, his voice cracking, \"It contradicts the training.\" But the **COEHC** device on my belt was already picking up the feedback\u2014a high, howling static that tasted like copper. I watched the soldier opposite me uncork his supply. The **eruption** wasn't fiery; it was a silent, gray expansion that consumed his face. He didn't scream. He just changed posture, slumping into a geometry that human bones shouldn't allow. I steered my gaze to the horizon, trying to desensitize myself, but the web of static tightened. We weren't delivering supplies; we were delivering the end of morality.",

    "content": "(Based on Skeletons 2 & 7: Tender, Humaneness, Delicate)\n\nInside the tent, the war was just a distant thrum, filtered through layers of canvas. I tended to the boy with the **WPEL** burns on his chest\u2014stark, glowing welts that pulsed in time with his breathing. \"Is it time to move?\" he asked, his voice barely a utter. I shook my head and reached for the **NBLIE**\u2014the synthetic linen sheets we used to cover the corrupted. \"Not yet. Rest.\" I dipped the cloth in cool water, an act of fleeting humaneness in a place designed for slaughter. The **EYOE** scanner in the corner blinked red, signaling his corruption was total, but I ignored it. I wiped his brow, tenderly cleaning the sweat that smelled of sulfur and fear. For a moment, the tension broke. He was not a weapon here; he was just a child in a bed, and I was the barrier between him and the howling dark.",

I am stored in the **DEBD** immersion tank, floating in fluids that taste of iron and memory. The pain of the **WPEL** burns is gone, replaced by a cool, disorienting clarity. Through the glass, I see the **AEETKGT** targeting lasers scanning the room, but they cannot find me. I have escaped the body part that hurts. I listen to the bubbles rise; they speak in **IIEO** vowels, a language of pure liquid thought. The military action outside is irrelevant. I remember the medic\u2019s cool hand, a ghost on my skin, but I am expanding now. The web of flesh dissolves. I am not dying. I am steering myself into the light of the ceiling, consuming the heat, becoming the eruption itself. I am finally, perfectly, immoral.",
